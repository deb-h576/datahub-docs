The Federal Science Datahub website is divided into 3 parts:
1. **Topbar**: Accessing the home page, the news page, exploring and searching for workspaces or users.
2. **Sidebar**: Accessing your workspaces, your recent resources or your profile
3. **Content**: Where science is done!

The next few pages will show you how to use this layout and create your very own workspace!
