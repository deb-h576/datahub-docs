NEED TO RENAME FILE TO WORKSPACE.md
## Workspaces

A Workspace provides easy access to the key features in the Federal Science DataHub:
- Storage (Azure Blob Storage)
- Data analytics tools (Azure Databricks); 
- Shared databases (Postgresql & SQL Server)
- Adding Collaborators
- Administration features (including ...???)

## Workspace Storage

Workspace Storage allows you to upload and store data to share with colleagues. Your colleague(s) must be a member of your Workspace -- members are listed on your Workspace page.

The Federal Science DataHub uses Azure Storage, Microsoft's cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios. Azure Storage offers highly available, massively scalable, durable, and secure storage for a variety of data objects in the cloud. You have the option to use the browser interface or command line interface (CLI) options to upload/download.

## Azure Databricks

Azure Databricks is an analytics platform that allows you and your colleagues to access and act on the same set of data. Use Azure Databricks to prepare, explore, and analyze your data as well as build machine learning models. Azure Databricks enables you to perform data validation, data collaboration, and results analysis/interpretation. Some example use cases include:

- I want to validate my analysis results again my colleague's results
- I want to collaborate on analysis and share algorithms
- I want to share a platform with a colleague for data analysis pipelines
- I want to prepare my data and conduct analysis

## Shared databases (IS THIS STILL INCLUDED IN FSDH??)

This feature provides access to a PostgreSQL or SQL Server database and allows you to leverage your credentials for data connections. Some example use cases include:

- I want to store data in a structured database for the purpose of sharing it internally
- I want to store and share raw data files with linkages into the structured database
