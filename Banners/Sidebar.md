In the first section, you will find the workspaces you are a part of, as well as the button to create a new workspace. As you are just getting started, we recommend you create a workpace!

In the second section, you will find a list of the recent resources you have accessed. From there, you can quickly multitask by jumping back and forth between different resources.
