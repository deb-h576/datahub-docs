RENAME TO WORKSPACE STORAGE

## Storage Explorer

The current tab shows the Storage Explorer that enables you to browse the workspace files. You can interact with the web interface and drag and drop files to upload, download, or delete them as needed.

__Note: the web interface is not recommended for any files larger than a gigabyte, as this can be dependent on your network connection.__

## AzCopy

AzCopy is the recommended approach for managing large data files inside the Project Storage. Click on "AzCopy" tab below for more details.
