## Creating Workspaces in FSDH Proof-of-Concept 
- All workspaces must be approved by the FSDH Team for the Proof-of-Concept. 
- Before creating a workspace, ensure you are pre-approved by the FSDH Team through the PoC Application Process.
- If you are not pre-approved any "Create Workspace" attempt will be rejected by the FSDH Admin. 
- To request an additional Workspace during the Proof-of-Concept perion, please submit a formal request for consideration using the [FSDH Support Request Form](https://forms.office.com/r/zk82ehvUtv).
