## Welcome to the FSDH PoC Phase 2

Welcome to the Federal Science DataHub (FSDH) Proof-of-Concept (PoC), an initiative supported by the Data Solutions for Science Team within Shared Services Canada’s Science Program. 

The scope of PoC Phase 2 includes: intuitive self-service; quick and temporary data storage; readily available digital tools for analytics, visualization, and machine learning models; collaboration with peers across GC; discovery metadata.

The objective of the PoC is to have active participation from scientists in as many Science-based Departments and Agencies as possible to ensure we have the right people to help evaluate, confirm, and prioritize capabilities and services for GC data storage, collaboration, and analysis.

## Limited use

The Federal Science DataHub is intended to support the advancement of science. As such, the FSDH PoC Phase 2 is limited to the use of GC scientists and collaborators that have specific science use cases and are willing and able to contribute to the evaluation of this Proof-of-Concept. Use of FSDH is not intended for a corporate/administrative project (e.g., Finance, HR).

## Timeline  

FSDH PoC Phase 2 will run from April 3 to September 30, 2023.  Participants requiring access to the environment and/or their data after that date can work with the DSS team to determine the approach for data migration, etc. 

## Non-sensitive (unclassified) information

“Unclassified” or a lack of security marking denotes non-sensitive data. This is data that, if released to the public, carries no injury to personal, industry, or government interests

- You don’t need to do anything special to protect this data.
- It is your responsibility to conclude the data is unclassified/non-sensitive before uploading to FSDH

For more information security of information, please see:

- [Directive on Security Management - Appendix J: Standard on Security Categorization](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32614)

## Privacy/Permissions 

Each workspace in FSDH is a restricted/private space open only to individuals specified by the Workspace lead. FSDH administrators will also have access to workspaces. 

## Respecting Canada’s Official Languages 

FSDH is meant to enable interdepartmental collaboration and thus when posting data, you should consider your role within your organization, your work responsibilities, and your intended audience. We advise that official content and content intended for broad dissemination be provided in both official languages. 

## Data Management 

The FSDH PoC Phase 2 includes mandatory workspace metadata to enable discovery. Other data management capabilities will be addressed in future (e.g., cataloguing features and lifecycle management).  

## Support

FSDH PoC Phase 2 will be supported by the DSS Team on a best-effort basis. All questions/issues can be sent to the team via the [FSDH Support Request Form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=lMFb0L-U1kquLh2w8uOPXhksOXzZ73RCp9fVTz4vTU5UNTc1U00yNVUxWVg4SkJGMFVHN1RCTTdQRS4u).
