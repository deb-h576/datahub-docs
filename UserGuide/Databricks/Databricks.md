## Azure Databricks for Cloud Analytics

Databricks is a platform similar to Jupyter notebooks and enables scientists to create and share documents that include live code, equations, and other multimedia resources. Databricks integrates with cloud storage and security in your cloud account, and manages and deploys cloud infrastructure on your behalf.

### Accessing Storage through Databricks

The DataHub provides an unified environment with storage and databricks and each workspace includes a storage account that can be accessed through Databricks using mount points. (DOES THIS NEED MORE DETAIL??)
