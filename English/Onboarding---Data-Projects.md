## Why would I use Data Projects?

Data Projects are created for each team who needs to collaborate on data and access cloud resources.

## What is a Data Project

A Data Project provides easy access to the key features in the DataHub:
- Storage (Azure Blob Storage)
- Data analytics tools (Azure Databricks); 
- Power BI workspaces
- Shared databases (Postgresql & SQL Server)
- Administration features and onboarding of other users
